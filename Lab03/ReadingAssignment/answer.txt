1. Is JAVA a Pass by Value or a Pass by Reference programming language?  
	=> Java is a Pass by Value language.

2. After the call of swap(jungleDVD, cinderellaDVD) why does the title of these two objects still remain? 
	=>  When we call swap, Java actually creates 2 new copies of jungleDVD and cinderellaDVD on stack, they are pointer to the object (object are in heap segment). 
	   The swap function only swap pointer to other object, not changing any data in object/heap segment so after the function ends, title of these two object still remain

3. After the call of changeTitle(jungleDVD, cinderellaDVD.getTitle()) why is the title of the JungleDVD changed? 
	=> When the function is called, a new reference dvd is created and point to jungleDVD. The change of the title in reference dvd with the method setTitle leads to the change of the object jungleDVD. 
	   After that, we assigned the new object to dvd. However, jungleDVD is not affected since dvd is now pointing to the newly created object.

4. Write a toString() method for the DigitalVideoDisc class. What should be the return type of this method?
	=> It should return a String.
